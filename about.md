This page is designed to tell you a little bit more about myself.

The social forces that shape human life fascinate me, from the structure of cities to the nature of poverty. I love the structure of social phenomenon. But I also believe that meaningful analysis has to be rooted in my role as a citizen of my community, my country, and the world.

For the past few years, I've been focused on refugee resettlement and education policy. During my gap year in Atlanta, I served as the Research Intern at the Global Village Project, a school for refugee girls in Decatur, Georgia. Whether working in classrooms or writing memos, I hope to shed light a lost generation of students caught in conflict.

One of the ways I've tried to do that is with research. Until now, most of the research I've done has been empirical in nature. I won first place in the economics category of the MIT Inspire research competition in 2016 for my research on forced displacement and education. I was also a 2017 Intel ISEF finalist for my research on minimum wage and educational achievement.
