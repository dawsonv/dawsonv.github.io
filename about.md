This page is designed to tell you a little bit more about me.

The social forces that shape human life fascinate me, from the structure of cities to the nature of poverty. I love the structure of social phenomenon. But I also believe that meaningful analysis has to be rooted in my role as a citizen of my community, my country, and the world.

For the past few years, I've been focused on refugee resettlement and education policy. Through a state department scholarship, I had the honor of spending six weeks in Jordan in the summer of 2015, an experience which catalyzed my interest in refugee issues, particularly refugee education.

In high school, I pursued that interest through empirical research. I won first place in the economics category of the MIT Inspire research competition in 2016 for my work on the impacts of refugees on native students. I was also a 2017 Intel ISEF finalist for my research on minimum wages and educational achievement in Canada.

During my gap year in Atlanta, I served as the Research Intern at the Global Village Project, a school for refugee girls in Decatur, Georgia. Whether working in classrooms or writing memos, I hope to shine a light on a lost generation of students caught in conflict.

These days,
