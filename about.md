This page is designed to tell you a bit more about me. Soon, I'll have more information on current projects, blog posts, and more! For now, here's a short bio. I graduated from Stanford in 2023 with a B.A.H. in political science. I'm interested in quantitative social science research. I'm especially interested in applications of statistical machine learning.

I have experience in public policy. I've also worked full-time and as an independent contractor on lots of data-driven research projects. If you want to work together, or you want to hire me, please reach out!
