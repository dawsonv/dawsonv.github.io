# <span style="color:blue">Dawson Verley - About</span>

Hi! My name is Dawson. I'm currently a second-year master's student in the Energy and Resources Group (ERG) at UC Berkeley, where I'm advised by Professor Duncan Callaway. I use statistics and machine learning to accelerate research on sustainable development, particularly in the areas of energy, environmental public health, and public policy. This past summer, I was a Digital Futures Research Intern in the Division of Energy Systems at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Before grad school, I worked in research and environmental policy. I received my undergraduate degree in political science from Stanford University in 2022. You can also reach me by email at verley [at] berkeley.edu.
