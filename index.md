Hi! My name is Dawson. I’m interested in statistics, machine learning, public policy, and quantitative social science research. Recently, I’ve been particularly focused on combinatorial optimization and natural language processing. If you’re interested in collaborating, or if you want to hire me as an independent contractor, please reach out!
