Hey! My name is Dawson. I'm a second-year master's student in the [Energy and Resources Group at UC Berkeley](https://erg.berkeley.edu/), where I’m advised by [Professor Duncan Callaway](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/duncan-callaway). 

My academic and professional interests lie at the intersection of energy systems, machine learning, and public policy. I'm particularly interested in the engineering and policy implications of automated trading in wholesale energy markets. With collaborators in the [Division of Energy Systems at KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.energy.kth.se/energy-systems/division-of-energy-systems), I also work on applications of machine learning and remote sensing in global energy transition modeling. 

Before grad school, I was a legislative aide in Alaska's State House, where I worked on energy and natural resources policy. I also worked as a research data analyst at Stanford, and as a research fellow (computational science) at Stanford Law School. I received my undergraduate degree in Political Science from Stanford, where I graduated with honors and distinction. 

If you want to get in touch, my current email address is verley [at] berkeley.edu. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/dawsonv).
