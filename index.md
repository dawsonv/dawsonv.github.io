Hey! My name is Dawson. I'm currently a second-year master's student at UC Berkeley. I'm affiliated with the [Energy and Resources Group (ERG)](https://erg.berkeley.edu/) and the Energy Modeling, Analysis and Control Group (EMAC), and advised by [Professor Duncan Callaway](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/duncan-callaway). 

I use data science, machine learning, statistics, optimization, and control theory to understand and improve modern energy systems. I'm particularly interested in wholesale energy markets and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). I also work on applications of machine learning and remote sensing in global energy transition modeling. As a Graduate Student Instructor at Berkeley, I've helped introduce more than 500 students to ML and data science. 

Before grad school, I was a legislative aide in Alaska's State House, where I worked on energy and natural resources policy. I also worked as a research data analyst at Stanford, and as a research fellow (computational science) at Stanford Law School. I received my undergraduate degree in Political Science from Stanford, where I graduated with honors and distinction. 

If you want to get in touch, my current email address is verley [at] berkeley.edu. You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/dawsonv), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dawson-verley-510618248/) and [Twitter/X](https://x.com/verley_dawson).
