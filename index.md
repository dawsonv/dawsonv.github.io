Hi! My name is Dawson. I'm a second-year master's student in the Energy and Resources Group (ERG) at UC Berkeley. Iâ€™m interested in statistics, machine learning, public policy, and a bunch of other stuff. These days I'm mostly focused on machine learning for modern energy ststems. I'm also interested in transportation, cities, buildings, and other issues at the nexus of data, markets, policy, and the environment. Before grad school, I was a research data analyst in Stanford's political science department, a legislative aide in Alaska's state house, and a research fellow at Stanford Law School. I recieved my B.A.H. in political science from Stanford.
